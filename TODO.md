# TODO: CRT Shell, Rootfs, And Porting Loop

This file tracks the shell/rootfs/porting work queue. The list is ordered by
state: completed work first, current work second, and planned follow-up last.
Detailed policy and provenance stay in `docs/` and import manifests.

## done

- Established `shell/` as a core CRT artifact area, not a third-party port
  recipe.
- Built `crt_tiny_sh`, Android `external/mksh`, and Android `external/toybox`
  through CMake.
- Generated an Android-like rootfs with `/system/bin`, `/bin`, `/usr/bin`,
  `/tmp`, `/dev`, and `/proc/self`.
- Installed mksh and the minimal configure-oriented toybox applet set into the
  rootfs.
- Kept POSIX hosts on symlink aliases and Windows on copy-based `.exe` aliases.
- Added the first Windows shell child process contract:
  - cwd/rootfs/env propagation;
  - fd snapshot export/import;
  - file actions and close-on-exec filtering;
  - child registry integration;
  - `waitpid()` coverage;
  - socket fd transport through `WSADuplicateSocketA()`.
- Documented real Windows `fork()` as a long-term PAL research tranche instead
  of blocking the mksh/toybox milestone on full fork emulation.
- Made Windows rootfs mksh run single external commands, external-command
  pipelines, builtin-to-external pipelines, and basic input/output redirection
  against CRT toybox applets.
- Fixed Windows toybox `ls -al` directory entries that showed `?` metadata for
  `.` and `..`.
- Recorded toybox LP64/LLP64 patches in `shell/toybox/PATCHES.md`; active fixes
  cover `dirtree.extra`, `ls`, the common option parser, Windows applet path
  lookup, and known active pointer-tagging paths.
- Kept zlib aligned with Android's model: zlib is a separate `libz`
  sysroot/runtime library surface, not part of Bionic libc.
- Confirmed AOSP does not carry GNU make under `platform/external`; Android
  carries make source under `toolchain/make` and prebuilts under
  `platform/prebuilts/build-tools`.
- Added `porting/recipes/make.json` and built Android `toolchain/make` as the
  first CRT-owned bootstrap build tool.
- Taught configure recipes to prefer `PORT_PREFIX/bin/make` before falling back
  to host make.
- Unified configure recipe launching through rootfs mksh for Windows, macOS,
  and Linux target flows.
- Made Windows CRT-shell configure recipes run `make -j 1` and pass
  `SHELL=/system/bin/mksh` so recipe commands stay on the project shell/process
  path.
- Completed Windows x86_64 zlib `./configure --static && make && make install`
  through rootfs mksh and CRT-built make.
- Set the zlib recipe to undefine Windows compiler predefines so upstream zlib
  stays on its generic POSIX path rather than selecting the Win32 `<io.h>`
  branch.
- Set zlib `RANLIB=true` because the optional zlib ranlib step is redundant for
  the LLVM archive path and exposed a Windows mksh subshell status quirk.
- Added Bionic/POSIX CRT surface exposed by make/zlib/shell work:
  - `alloca.h`;
  - `ar.h`;
  - `memrchr`;
  - `confstr`;
  - `_CS_PATH` / `_CS_V7_ENV`;
  - `ttyname`;
  - `getlogin`;
  - `eaccess`;
  - `bsd_signal`;
  - `EXIT_SUCCESS` / `EXIT_FAILURE`;
  - `putenv`;
  - `pselect`.
- Added or expanded regression tests for:
  - string memory helpers;
  - `confstr`/sysconf behavior;
  - `pselect`;
  - process signal helpers;
  - Windows fd snapshot and spawn attribute behavior.
- Updated the active status docs:
  - `docs/sysroot_ports.md`;
  - `docs/porting_status.md`;
  - `docs/shell_import.md`;
  - `docs/windows_fork_emulation.md`;
  - `shell/toybox/PATCHES.md`.
- Fixed the `port-rebuild-zlib` `make -j 10` deadlock: `sigaction()`/
  `sigprocmask()` previously only updated process-local bookkeeping with no
  real OS-level signal delivery, so GNU make's jobserver `pselect()` could
  never be interrupted by a real `SIGCHLD`. Added a per-OS
  `crt_signal_backend` (macOS: real `sigaction`/`sigprocmask` via a shared
  Mach-O export-trie helper now also reused by `libdl`; Linux: raw
  `rt_sigaction`/`rt_sigprocmask` syscalls plus an x86_64 restorer
  trampoline; Windows: honest no-op stub) and fixed a separate `pselect()`
  lost-wakeup race (`libc/src/poll.c`) where an already-pending signal was
  silently swallowed by the non-atomic mask-then-select sequence. Verified
  against the real `port-rebuild-zlib` `configure && make -j 10 && make
  install` end to end on macOS. See `docs/signal_delivery.md`.
- Fixed Windows aarch64 compile errors (`init_ntdll`/`fd_set_inherit_for_fork`
  unused-function under `-Werror`): both only backed the x86_64-only
  `RtlCloneUserProcess` fork path and were genuinely dead code on aarch64;
  guarded behind the same `#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(_M_X64)`
  already used at their call site.
- Fixed 3 Windows aarch64 fork test failures (`fork_test`,
  `fork_signal_test`, `fork_runtime_reset_test`): only one of four
  `fork()`/`_Fork()` call sites treated Windows `ENOTSUP` as an expected,
  graceful pass; extended the same handling to the other three.
- Fixed 3 Windows aarch64 mksh rootfs ctest failures
  (`crt_mksh_rootfs_external_runs`/`_pipeline_runs`/`_command_substitution_runs`):
  root cause was a stale/missing `rootfs` build artifact, not a code bug --
  the `rootfs` CMake custom target had no `ALL` and nothing forced it to
  rebuild before ctest ran. Made `rootfs` part of `ALL` on Windows (the only
  host where any ctest entry depends on it); macOS/Linux keep it opt-in.
- Found and fixed a real mksh/CRT-shell-child-spec bug while investigating a
  separate, silent (`zero output, exit 1`) `port-rebuild-zlib` `./configure`
  failure on Windows aarch64: `MKSH_CRT_SHELL_CHILD_SPEC`'s `exchild()` fast
  path incorrectly ran `TPAREN` (subshells) in-process like `TCOM`, so a
  subshell's own redirection (e.g. `(cmd) 2>/dev/null`) permanently
  clobbered the interpreter's real stderr with nothing to restore it,
  silently swallowing every later error in the same script. Fixed by
  restricting the fast path to `TCOM` only (`shell/mksh/src/jobs.c`) --
  and found a second, independent copy of the same guard inside
  `execute()` itself (`shell/mksh/src/exec.c`), reached directly by
  `comsub()` (backtick/`$(...)` substitution) without ever going through
  `exchild()`, which is why the `jobs.c` fix alone did not change the
  observed behavior; fixed the same way. See
  `docs/windows_fork_emulation.md` for the full diagnosis. This does not make
  `zlib`'s `configure` pass on Windows aarch64 (still needs real `fork()`
  there), but turns the silent corruption into an honest `can't fork - try
  again` failure, and fixes a latent version of the same bug on Windows
  x86_64 (where real fork already exists).
- Made real `fork()` work on Windows aarch64 (`RtlCloneUserProcess` is
  exported there too; the previous x86_64-only guards in
  `libc/src/arch/windows/common/syscall.c` were simply untested
  assumptions) and fixed a genuine `fd_set_inherit_for_fork()` bug found
  along the way (fd 0/1/2 were never marked inheritable, breaking
  `2>&1` inside a forked subshell). This alone didn't make
  `configure`-driven builds work, though: `CreateProcessA()` (and, it
  turned out, `CreatePipe()`) both crash/fail when called from inside an
  unregistered `RtlCloneUserProcess` clone, because the clone never goes
  through CreateProcess's CSRSS registration handshake. Benchmarked the
  cost of routing spawns through `CreateProcessA` instead of raw fork
  (~1.2x, not the order-of-magnitude Cygwin reputation suggests),
  researched prior art (no documented CSRSS re-registration method
  exists; ruled out as too fragile), and built a "spawn broker": `fork()`
  stays untouched (still cheap `RtlCloneUserProcess`), but
  `__crt_sys_posix_spawn()` now detects when it is running inside an
  unregistered clone and, in that case, asks an always-running, never-
  cloned broker process (`libc/src/arch/windows/common/spawn_broker.c`,
  protocol in `libc/include/private/crt_spawn_broker.h`) to create the
  pipe and the real target process on its behalf, handing the resulting
  handles back via `DuplicateHandle`. Verified end to end on real Windows
  aarch64 hardware: `cmake --build --preset windows-host-ninja-debug
  --target port-rebuild-zlib` now completes zlib's full
  `configure && make && make install` with exit 0 (previously failed at
  `can't fork - try again`, then at a `CreateProcessA` crash, then at a
  `CreatePipe()` failure -- each fix exposing the next layer). Full
  `ctest` stays green (77/77) throughout. See
  `docs/windows_fork_emulation.md`, "Chosen Direction: Spawn Broker", for
  the full investigation, the benchmark numbers, the prior-art research,
  and the rejected alternatives (CSRSS re-registration, full Cygwin-style
  memory-copy `fork()`).

## in progressing

- Started running libpng's real `configure && make && make install` through
  project-owned mksh/make on Windows aarch64 (`port-rebuild-libpng`, depends
  on zlib already installed to `PORT_PREFIX`). Not passing yet, but found and
  fixed three real, independent CRT/mksh bugs along the way, each verified
  against the full `ctest` suite (78/78) with no regressions:
  - **`regcomp()`/`regexec()` never implemented capture groups**
    (`libc/src/regex.c`): `\( \)` (BRE) / `( )` (ERE) were either treated as
    literal parenthesis characters to match (BRE) or silently miscounted
    into `re_nsub` (both modes), so `regmatch_t` subexpression bounds were
    never populated. This broke the extremely common autoconf idiom `expr
    "x$opt" : 'x--[^-]*-\(.*\)'` used to parse `--enable-X`/`--disable-X`/
    `--prefix=VALUE` style flags -- `./configure --disable-shared
    --enable-static --prefix=...` was silently corrupted into `--disable-0
    --enable-0 --prefix=0` before libpng's (autoconf-generated, unlike
    zlib's hand-written) `configure` ever got going. Rewrote the matcher to
    track real capture groups through backtracking (see `regex_test.c`),
    and fixed `re_nsub` counting to be BRE/ERE-mode-aware instead of always
    counting unescaped `(`.
  - **mksh never recognized Windows drive-letter paths as absolute**
    (`shell/mksh/src/sh.h`, `mksh_abspath()`): mksh already ships a full
    DOS-path-aware implementation behind `MKSH_DOSPATH`, but that flag also
    switches `PATH`/`CDPATH` to `;`-separated, which conflicts with this
    project's deliberate `:`-separated rootfs `PATH` convention
    (`/system/bin:/bin:/usr/bin`, see `tools/crt-port-build.py`). Added a
    narrower, CRT-owned `MKSH_CRT_WINPATH` define (alongside the existing
    `MKSH_CRT_ALLOW_LLP64`/`MKSH_CRT_SHELL_CHILD_SPEC`) that only patches
    `mksh_abspath`/`mksh_cdirsep`/`mksh_sdirsep` to recognize `X:\`/`X:/`
    and `\` as well as `/`, without touching `MKSH_PATHSEPC`. Without this,
    `cd "$(pwd)"` (autoconf's own `ac_pwd`/`ls -di .` working-directory
    sanity check) silently treated the Windows-native absolute path
    `getcwd()` returns as *relative*, doubling it into `<dir>/<dir>` and
    failing with `configure: error: working directory cannot be
    determined`.
  - **Generic `pipe()` has the same CreateProcessA-adjacent failure as the
    spawn broker's own bootstrap pipe, but was never routed through the
    broker** (`libc/src/arch/windows/common/syscall.c`,
    `spawn_broker.c`/`crt_spawn_broker.h`): `__crt_sys_pipe()` called
    `CreatePipe()` unconditionally, with no check for
    `__crt_windows_is_unregistered_clone()`. mksh forks a real subshell
    (`RtlCloneUserProcess` clone) for every command substitution/pipeline,
    and any further pipe needed *inside* that clone (nested command
    substitution, `cmd1 | cmd2`) hit exactly the already-diagnosed
    `CreatePipe()`-fails-in-an-unregistered-clone bug -- just reached via
    plain shell usage instead of `posix_spawn()`. Extended the broker
    protocol with a `want_plain_pipe` request (broker creates a pipe
    locally and `DuplicateHandle`s *both* ends back into the client,
    instead of attaching one end to a spawned target) and made
    `__crt_sys_pipe()` route through it when inside an unregistered clone.
  - Also found and fixed a fourth real bug along the way, confirmed
    necessary but **not sufficient on its own** -- see "still open" below:
    `ERROR_INVALID_NAME` (Windows error 123, returned for any path
    containing a character Windows never allows in a real filename, e.g.
    `*`) fell through `map_windows_error()`'s default case to `EIO`
    instead of `ENOENT`. Autoconf's own exit-trap cleanup runs `rm -f core
    *.core core.conftest.*`; when the glob doesn't match anything, mksh
    passes the literal pattern through (normal, expected shell behavior),
    and a literal `*` can never exist as a real Windows filename, so
    `ENOENT` is the semantically correct mapping -- and it is exactly what
    toybox's `rm -f` checks for to stay silent
    (`shell/toybox/src/toys/posix/rm.c:110`, `errno == ENOENT`). Fixed in
    `map_windows_error()`. Verified against the full `ctest` suite (78/78).
  - **Still open / where to pick this up:** even with all four fixes,
    libpng's `configure` still dies with exit 127 partway through
    `checking how to create a ustar tar archive` (the
    `for _am_tool in $_am_tools; do ... done` loop in automake's tar-format
    probe, around line 3647 of the generated `configure`). `set -x`
    tracing (inject `set -x` right before that line, in
    `out/windows-host-ninja-debug/port-tests/src/libpng-1.6.57/configure`
    so it survives `copy_source()`'s fresh-copy-per-`--rebuild`, then run
    `port-rebuild-libpng` and capture with `*> full_trace.log` -- piping
    through `Select-Object`/`ctest`-style truncation loses the interesting
    part) shows the trace running all the way to autoconf's own universal
    EXIT trap (`configure: exit`, `rm -f core *.core core.conftest.*`)
    with no visible anomaly in between, which is what led to (and was
    fully explained by) the `ERROR_INVALID_NAME` fix above -- but that fix
    alone did not make the failure go away, so **something else in the
    same loop still exits 127** and was not yet isolated. Next step: rerun
    the same `set -x` trace capture (to a file, not truncated) with the
    `ERROR_INVALID_NAME` fix in place, and diff against the prior trace to
    find exactly which statement's exit status changed. Prime suspects,
    not yet checked: the `am__tar_` `eval` inside `(tardir=conftest.dir &&
    eval $am__tar_ >conftest.tar) >&5 2>&5` when `_am_tar` never got set to
    a real binary (since `tar`/`gnutar`/`gtar` are all absent); or another
    instance of the already-documented CRT-shell-child-spec
    subshell/exit-status-propagation class of bug (see "Found and fixed a
    real mksh/CRT-shell-child-spec bug..." above, the `TPAREN` one) meaning
    a *different* subshell in this exact loop, not the exit-trap rm.

- Attempted to fix a real (if currently low-impact) gap in the spawn broker:
  every process it spawns shows up in Windows' own process tree as a child
  of the broker, not of the clone that logically requested it (flat instead
  of nested in Task Manager/Process Explorer/any future toybox `ps
  --forest`; `ps` itself is not enabled yet, `CFG_PS 0`). Tried the official
  `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS` mechanism (same one `explorer.exe`
  uses for UAC-elevated children). Found and fixed one real bug along the
  way (inheritable handles are sourced from the *specified parent's* handle
  table with this attribute, not the actual `CreateProcessA` caller's --
  the fd-snapshot bootstrap pipe's read end had to move from
  "inheritable in the broker" to "duplicated into the client, inheritable
  there"), but hit a second, worse regression that was never fully
  isolated: spawned targets started failing entirely with
  `STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED` (a Windows loader-level failure, before the
  target's own `main()` ever runs), and -- the important part -- disabling
  just the reparenting attribute did **not** reliably fix it, meaning
  something in this line of changes broke the plain, non-reparented spawn
  path too, not just the reparented one. Since the actual acceptance test
  (`port-rebuild-zlib`'s real `configure`/`make`/`make install`) regressed
  back to failing, reverted both changed files
  (`libc/src/arch/windows/common/spawn_broker.c` and `.../syscall.c`) via
  `git checkout --` to the last known-good commit rather than ship a
  half-fixed state. Confirmed the revert restores the working state (zlib
  passes, `ctest` 77/77). Full blow-by-blow, what to try differently next
  time, and why job-object inheritance was ruled out as the cause: see
  `docs/windows_fork_emulation.md`, "Attempted And Reverted: Reparenting
  Spawned Processes To The Client".

- Verify the new Linux signal backend (`docs/signal_delivery.md`) on an
  actual Linux host; it is currently code-review-verified only, since this
  project's CMake presets refuse to cross-compile from macOS.
- Add a permanent regression test for the `fork()` + blocked-`SIGCHLD` +
  `pselect()` pattern used to verify the signal delivery fix.

- Keep the Windows mksh child-spec path stable for real configure workloads:
  - external command execution;
  - `cmd | cmd`;
  - builtin-to-external pipelines;
  - `cmd > file`;
  - `cmd < file`;
  - fd 3 and higher redirections;
  - child exit status propagation;
  - multi-child and pipeline teardown.
- Harden Windows `waitpid()` and the child registry for multiple live children,
  configure-script subprocess bursts, and pipeline cleanup.
- Track the current Windows make limitation:
  - serial make is the supported path;
  - parallel make/jobserver fd inheritance is not complete;
  - this should be fixed in CRT/PAL process/fd handling, not by returning to
    host make.
- Audit the Windows mksh subshell status quirk exposed by commands shaped like
  `(command || true) >/dev/null 2>&1`.
- Continue validating that `CRT_SPAWN_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1` remains a narrow
  launcher hint for native host tools such as LLVM `ar`, `ranlib`, and `strip`,
  not an inherited global mode for configure recipes.
- Keep make/zlib/libpng/libffi recipe statuses current as each host is rerun.
- Keep auditing disabled toybox applets for pointer-to-`long` LLP64 assumptions
  before enabling them.
- Keep `/dev/tty`, `/dev/console`, `isatty`, `tcgetattr`, `tcsetattr`, and
  `TIOCGWINSZ` behavior coherent enough for non-interactive shell and configure
  use.
- Preserve the porting loop discipline:
  1. expose the missing header/type/macro/symbol/behavior with upstream source;
  2. check Android Bionic public headers, source, ABI, and errno policy;
  3. extend CRT/PAL/sysroot rather than patching upstream first;
  4. record host-specific policy differences in `docs/`.

## planed

- Finish the libpng/libffi/SQLite configure/make/install pass on Windows
  (see "in progressing" above for the current libpng blocker); libffi and
  the SQLite follow-up build beyond the current amalgamation smoke have not
  been attempted yet.
- Re-run the same make/zlib/libpng/libffi recipe path on macOS and Linux to
  confirm the unified mksh+make flow across hosts.
- Add focused tests for parallel make prerequisites before enabling `make -jN`
  on Windows:
  - inherited pipe fds;
  - jobserver-style pipe transport;
  - concurrent child wait;
  - close-on-exec filtering under load.
- Expand Windows shell smoke tests:
  - fd 3+ redirection inside mksh;
  - grouped commands;
  - background commands where non-interactive semantics are clear;
  - configure-script patterns involving subshells and redirections.
- Decide and document the minimal Windows console process-group policy needed
  for interactive mksh:
  - Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Break delivery;
  - foreground process group approximation;
  - stopped-child status policy.
- Add virtual rootfs files narrowly as porting workloads require them:
  - `/proc/mounts`;
  - `/proc/self/status`;
  - `/proc/self/cmdline`;
  - `/proc/self/environ`;
  - `/proc/stat`;
  - `/dev/zero`;
  - `/dev/random`;
  - `/dev/urandom`.
- Expand toybox applets only when the backing Bionic-compatible CRT/PAL surface
  exists. Likely next applets:
  - `which`: add as a lightweight toybox applet for configure and shell
    usability; mksh has `whence`/`command -v`-style builtins, but `which`
    should be provided as an external applet.
  - `readlink`;
  - `stat`;
  - `touch`.
- Keep deeper Linux-like applets deferred until the PAL owns enough backing
  behavior:
  - `ps`: add through toybox only after the rootfs/PAL provides enough
    `/proc` process data; this is not an mksh builtin.
  - `mount`;
  - `df`;
  - `ifconfig`;
  - `stty`;
  - `login`;
  - device-manager or procfs-heavy commands.
- Continue long-term Windows `fork()` research separately from the immediate
  mksh/toybox milestone:
  - saved register/context state;
  - stack mapping/copy policy;
  - writable runtime/data segment policy;
  - TLS/current-thread reset in the child;
  - malloc/pthread/stdio/fd after-fork reset hooks;
  - ASLR/base-address constraints or documented failure mode.
