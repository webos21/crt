# TODO: CRT Shell, Rootfs, And Porting Loop

This file tracks the shell/rootfs/porting work queue. The list is ordered by
state: completed work first, current work second, and planned follow-up last.
Detailed policy and provenance stay in `docs/` and import manifests.

## note

- **Recipe/port status upkeep.** Keep recipe statuses
  (`porting/recipes/*.json`, `docs/porting_status.md`) current as each
  host is rerun.

- **Standing porting-loop discipline**, not a task list:
  1. expose the missing header/type/macro/symbol/behavior with upstream
     source;
  2. check Android Bionic public headers, source, ABI, and errno policy;
  3. extend CRT/PAL/sysroot rather than patching upstream first;
  4. record host-specific policy differences in `docs/`;
  5. **verify both the static AND shared build during the same porting
     pass, on every host, before calling a port done** -- not
     static-first-then-shared-as-a-follow-up. Several ports in this
     queue (bzip2, xz, pcre2, mbedtls) landed `static-pass` first and
     only got `shared-pass` in a later pass or after the user asked why
     shared hadn't been checked; going forward, a port's recipe/test
     entries and status write-up should cover both build shapes before
     the port is reported as finished, and a host-specific reason must
     be recorded in the recipe's own notes if shared is genuinely
     deferred for that host (e.g. a real missing SDK import library),
     not just left unmentioned.

  A few smaller, longer-running audits ride along with this:
  - Keep auditing disabled toybox applets for pointer-to-`long` LLP64
    assumptions before enabling them (see `HISTORY.md`'s `which`/
    `readlink`/`stat` and `id`/`xargs` entries for the most recent
    batches actually enabled).
  - Keep `/dev/tty`, `/dev/console`, `isatty`, `tcgetattr`, `tcsetattr`,
    and `TIOCGWINSZ` behavior coherent enough for non-interactive shell
    and configure use.
  - Continue validating that `CRT_SPAWN_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1` stays a narrow
    launcher hint for native host tools (LLVM `ar`/`ranlib`/`strip`), not
    an inherited global mode for configure recipes.

## done

See [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md) for the full, dated, reverse-chronological
record of completed work. This section stays empty in `TODO.md` itself --
when an item below is finished, move its writeup into `HISTORY.md` (dated,
newest entry first) rather than leaving it here.

## in progress

Active threads, not a flat list of one-off items. Remaining libc/PAL
residuals before the upper runtime phase (see `docs/runtime_roadmap.md`):

- Expand Windows shell smoke tests:
  - fd 3+ redirection inside mksh;
  - grouped commands;
  - background commands where non-interactive semantics are clear;
  - configure-script patterns involving subshells and redirections.
- Decide and document the minimal Windows console process-group policy needed
  for interactive mksh:
  - Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Break delivery;
  - foreground process group approximation;
  - stopped-child status policy.
- Add virtual rootfs files narrowly as porting workloads require them:
  - `/proc/mounts`;
  - `/proc/self/status`;
  - `/proc/self/cmdline`;
  - `/proc/self/environ`;
  - `/proc/stat`;
  - `/dev/zero`.
  (`/dev/random`/`/dev/urandom` are done -- see `HISTORY.md`'s curl HTTPS
  entry.)
- Expand toybox applets only when the backing Bionic-compatible CRT/PAL
  surface exists. `which`/`readlink`/`stat`/`touch`/`id`/`xargs` are done
  (see `HISTORY.md`) -- next candidates would come from auditing the
  remaining disabled applets for LLP64 pointer-width safety.
- Keep deeper Linux-like applets deferred until the PAL owns enough backing
  behavior:
  - `ps`: add through toybox only after the rootfs/PAL provides enough
    `/proc` process data; this is not an mksh builtin.
  - `mount`;
  - `df`;
  - `ifconfig`;
  - `stty`;
  - `login`;
  - device-manager or procfs-heavy commands.

## planned

### Upper runtime roadmap after libc/PAL cleanup

The long-term target is an Electron-class rebuilt native application runtime,
not Electron itself as the next port. See `docs/runtime_roadmap.md`.

- **libcrtjs**: start with QuickJS to expose event-loop, module-loading,
  filesystem, timer, native-binding, and process gaps at manageable scale.
  Keep V8 as the final browser-class JavaScript engine target after the C++
  runtime, JIT/code-memory policy, atomics, threading, and dynamic loading are
  stronger.
- **libcrtgfx**: build toward Skia plus a Wayland-compatible compositor
  boundary, with a Chromium Ozone backend as the long-term browser integration
  path. Host window/GPU APIs stay below the graphics PAL.
- **libcrtmedia**: build toward FFmpeg and explicit codec/audio/video
  libraries, with software decode first and later hardware acceleration through
  host backends that interoperate with `libcrtgfx`.
