# TODO: CRT Shell, Rootfs, And Porting Loop

This file tracks the shell/rootfs/porting work queue. Only current work and
planned follow-up stay here; completed work moves to `HISTORY.md` in reverse
chronological order. Detailed policy and provenance stay in `docs/` and import
manifests.

## Notice

- Keep recipe statuses current in
  [`porting/recipes/*.json`](porting/recipes/) and
  [`docs/porting_status.md`](docs/porting_status.md) whenever a host is
  rerun. Porting policy and the normal configure/make loop live in
  [`docs/sysroot_ports.md`](docs/sysroot_ports.md); completed porting
  investigations belong in [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md).
- A port is not done until both static and shared builds are attempted
  in the same pass on each host, with any host-specific deferral recorded
  in the recipe notes and status matrix. See
  [`docs/porting_status.md`](docs/porting_status.md) for status meanings.
- For CMake wiring changes, do not trust a long-lived local `out/`
  directory. Verify with a fresh clone or at least
  `cmake --fresh --preset <preset>` before calling the change done; stale
  `CMakeCache.txt`/rootfs artifacts have hidden real CI-only ordering
  bugs before. The resolved cases are recorded in [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md).
- Keep toybox applet enablement tied to audited CRT/PAL support, especially
  LLP64 assumptions on Windows. The live applet list and deferrals are in
  [`docs/toybox_applet_status.md`](docs/toybox_applet_status.md).
- Keep terminal/tty behavior coherent for shell and configure use. Current
  syscall/ioctl coverage is tracked in
  [`docs/sysroot_ports.md`](docs/sysroot_ports.md), with interactive job
  control policy deferred in [`docs/job_control.md`](docs/job_control.md).
- Treat `CRT_SPAWN_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1` as a narrow launcher hint for native
  host tools only. The wrapper details live in [`tools/crt-cc`](tools/crt-cc),
  [`tools/crt-c++`](tools/crt-c++), [`tools/crt-native-tool`](tools/crt-native-tool),
  and [`docs/sysroot_ports.md`](docs/sysroot_ports.md).
- If a new public libc or `__crt_sys_*` symbol is added, regenerate or replace
  [`porting/recipes/mbedtls-windows-exclude-symbols.rsp`](porting/recipes/mbedtls-windows-exclude-symbols.rsp)
  in the same pass. The reason is documented in
  [`porting/recipes/mbedtls.json`](porting/recipes/mbedtls.json) and
  [`docs/porting_status.md`](docs/porting_status.md).
- Keep work status in exactly one place per purpose, not restated across all
  three: [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md) holds the detailed, dated record of what
  was actually done and why; an item here in `TODO.md` should track live
  progress in a line or two, not re-narrate what a finished sub-part already
  accomplished (once something is done, move the detail to `HISTORY.md` and
  cut it here rather than leaving both). [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) is updated
  only when explicitly asked for, not as part of routine documentation
  passes -- do not touch it on a normal work/doc-cleanup turn.


## Done

See [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md) for the full, dated, reverse-chronological
record of completed work. This section stays empty in `TODO.md` itself --
when an item below is finished, move its writeup into `HISTORY.md` (dated,
newest entry first) rather than leaving it here.

## In Progress

- [ ] **Make the packaged Linux Vulkan/Skia demo directly runnable.** Fresh
  Linux/aarch64 04-stage acceptance passes the installed-source examples rebuilt
  against the packaged static CRT closure, but the prebuilt shared-runtime
  `examples/bin/crtgfx_skia_gpu_window_demo` cannot load a host Vulkan ICD while
  Linux `libdl` remains a stub. Choose a package/link boundary that preserves CRT
  ABI isolation, then add a direct packaged-binary smoke. This is separate from
  the resolved Skia heap-corruption blocker and does not invalidate the completed
  04-stage release gate.

## Planned

### CRT allocator and runtime architecture hardening

An external architecture review (2026-09-14, prompted by the now-resolved
Linux/aarch64 Skia heap-corruption investigation) looked at `libc/src/malloc.c`,
`libc/CMakeLists.txt`, `libcrtgfx/CMakeLists.txt`, the malloc test suite, and
the Linux Skia/Wayland/Vulkan boundary, and proposed a P0/P1/P2-ranked set of
structural improvements. The `CRT_ENABLE_DEBUG_MALLOC` diagnostic used during
that investigation is implemented; the broader architecture changes below
remain unstarted. Promote them into "In Progress" individually once a concrete
need or consumer justifies the cost, per this file's usual promotion
discipline.

P0:

1. **Separate the bootstrap allocator from a production allocator.**
   `libc/src/malloc.c` is a clear, easy-to-audit design for CRT bring-up,
   but its `malloc()`/`free()`/new-chunk paths are all linear scans
   (`append_chunk()` walks the whole chunk list to find its tail;
   `malloc_unlocked()` first-fits linearly; `coalesce_free_blocks()`
   rescans the whole free list on every `free()`), all under one global
   `heap_lock` spinlock -- `O(N)` per operation as allocation count `N`
   grows, a real risk once Skia/FFmpeg/QuickJS/libc++ are all allocating
   heavily through it. Keep this implementation as the bootstrap/reference/
   diagnostic allocator; evaluate LLVM's Scudo Hardened Allocator (size-
   class allocators, per-thread caches, mmap-backed large allocations,
   built-in quarantine, official standalone build support) as the long-term
   production allocator -- a natural fit given this project's own Bionic-
   compatibility framing, since Scudo has been Android's own default
   allocator since Android 11.
2. **Keep `CRT_ENABLE_DEBUG_MALLOC`/`CRT_ENABLE_GUARD_MALLOC` as permanent
   diagnostic build modes**, not one-off debugging code. The completed
   Linux/aarch64 investigation established their immediate value; retain and
   test them as supported diagnostics.
3. **Draw an explicit "Host ABI firewall" boundary in the Linux graphics/
   media code.** The Vulkan GPU path already documents the specific reason
   it must use the *real host* `libwayland-client.so.0` rather than this
   project's own hand-rolled Wayland wire client: the host Vulkan WSI
   driver expects `libwayland-client`'s own private `wl_display` object
   layout, which differs from what this project's own Bionic-compatible
   `pthread_mutex_t` would produce if this project built that library
   itself. The same class of boundary will keep recurring as FFmpeg
   hardware acceleration, VA-API, PipeWire, and EGL are added. Write down
   the rule explicitly as project policy rather than re-deriving it per
   integration: a host library's own opaque objects (`wl_display*`,
   `VkInstance`, `VkDevice`, `AVHWDeviceContext`, ...) are only ever
   created and destroyed by that same host library -- never reinterpreted
   through, or allocated via, this project's own memory/object structures.
4. **Remove the "build once, then reconfigure" CMake pattern.** The native
   Wayland Vulkan WSI backend's own `CRTGFX_HAVE_NATIVE_WAYLAND` gate
   checks `EXISTS` on a generated `libxdg-shell-protocol.a` at *configure*
   time, so a genuinely clean tree needs `configure -> build
   crtgfx-wayland-build -> reconfigure -> build` -- already documented as a
   deliberate, temporary workaround for a real dependency-cycle risk, not
   a permanent design. Skia's own external/nested-build integration is
   accumulating similar shape. The durable fix is a physically separate
   superbuild stage (libc++/Wayland/Skia/FFmpeg as one dependency-prefix-
   producing phase) feeding a single, cycle-free runtime configure for
   `libcrtgfx`/`libcrtmedia` -- not another one-off `EXISTS` gate per new
   dependency. Budget real effort here given `05-js`'s QuickJS/V8 work will
   add at least one more such external dependency.

P1:

5. **Decouple `libc/src/malloc.c` from Windows fork emulation.**
   `heap_os_region_base[]`/`heap_os_region_size[]`/
   `__crt_malloc_os_region_count()`/`_base()`/`_size()` are this
   allocator's own OS-region bookkeeping, consumed directly by
   `arch/windows/*/fork_memcopy.c`. A future allocator swap (Scudo or
   otherwise) cannot honor this interface as-is. Extract a small, allocator-
   agnostic `crt_heap_region_count()`/`crt_heap_region_get()`-shaped
   interface between "whatever malloc implementation is active" and "the
   Windows fork snapshot walker" before attempting an allocator swap.
6. **Stop letting a compile macro change a shared struct's own layout.**
   `libcrtgfx/CMakeLists.txt` already carries a load-bearing comment
   explaining why `CRTGFX_HAVE_VULKAN` must be a directory-wide
   `add_compile_definitions()`, not a per-target one: `src/gpu.c` and
   `gpu_vulkan.c` both see the same `struct crtgfx_gpu_device`, and a
   mismatched definition between translation units changes that struct's
   own size, corrupting memory. The current fix (matching the definition
   everywhere) is correct, but the underlying shape -- one macro flip away
   from real memory corruption -- is itself worth removing as a class of
   bug: give `crtgfx_gpu_device` a fixed `{backend tag, ops vtable, opaque
   backend pointer}` layout and hide `CRTGFX_HAVE_VULKAN`/`_D3D12`/`_METAL`
   backend-specific fields entirely inside each backend's own translation
   unit, so the macro only ever changes which code exists, never the
   common struct's own layout.
7. **Move `tools/crt_dist_prerequisites.py`-style manifest thinking to
   `libc.so`'s own ELF export surface.** The current `CRT_1.0 { global: *;
   };` whole-surface version script (`libc/CMakeLists.txt`) is the right
   *shape* of fix for the collision recorded in the 2026-09-16 history entry,
   but long-term, generating the version-script/export list from an
   explicit Bionic-compatibility symbol manifest (public headers ->
   manifest -> generated `.map` file) would prevent accidental exports and
   give a real basis for `CRT_1.0`/`CRT_1.1`/`CRT_2.0`-style ABI evolution,
   rather than hand-maintaining `global: *;` indefinitely.
8. **Add an upper-stage smoke gate to routine CI**, not just the C stage.
   Every recent Linux ELF-collision-family bug (`libc` vs host glibc,
   `libc` vs `libc++`, `libc++` vs Skia, Wayland vs Vulkan, Skia vs Vulkan)
   showed up specifically at a *stage boundary*, not within `01-c` alone.
   Full Skia/FFmpeg builds are too slow for every PR, but a per-PR
   `02-cxx` smoke plus a headless `libcrtgfx` smoke, with a nightly full-
   Skia/FFmpeg/predecessor-only-dist/binary-import-audit pass from a
   genuinely empty build directory and cache (this project's own CMake
   state has already been shown to interact with external-build artifact
   presence -- see item 4), would have caught several of the bugs in
   `HISTORY.md`'s dated entries closer to when they were introduced.
9. **Grow the allocator test suite past API-correctness coverage.** The
   existing `libc/tests/malloc_test.c`-family coverage (malloc/calloc/
   realloc/large-allocation/alignment correctness, a 4-thread/200-iteration
   contention test) is solid for what it checks, but does not yet cover
   the shapes this investigation actually needed: large-N random alloc/
   free/realloc stress, higher thread counts, size-distribution/
   fragmentation workloads, RSS recovery after large free, fork under
   fragmentation/many-region conditions, and (once built) expected-fault
   tests for `CRT_ENABLE_GUARD_MALLOC`/double-free/cross-instance-owner
   detection. Track ops/sec, p50/p99 allocation latency, peak RSS, and a
   fragmentation ratio so a future bootstrap-to-Scudo decision (item 1) has
   numbers behind it, not just impression.

P2:

10. **Split the Linux Wayland backend into two independent implementations**
    instead of one code path that changes object universes depending on
    whether Vulkan is enabled. `STATUS.md` already records a real, current
    limitation in the hand-rolled path (the software-window adapter does
    not recycle Wayland object IDs); the GPU path already uses the real
    host `libwayland-client.so.0` entirely separately. Making that an
    explicit `crtgfx` Wayland abstraction with two backends (CRT wire
    protocol vs. host-native) rather than one file family that
    conditionally reinterprets its own objects would be easier to maintain
    as both paths keep evolving.
11. **Make binary/package/ABI lint an explicit acceptance gate.** Extend the
    distribution dependency and absolute-path checks with a separately
    runnable ABI audit: compare public exports and unresolved imports against
    the stage's declared symbol/dependency manifests, reject accidental host
    ABI leakage, and retain a baseline suitable for detecting incompatible
    changes between released CRT ABI versions.

### Upper runtime roadmap

The completed cross-host baseline and its exact validation evidence stay in
[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) and [`HISTORY.md`](HISTORY.md); the product boundary
and dependency order stay in [`docs/runtime_roadmap.md`](docs/runtime_roadmap.md).
Promote one tranche at a time into In Progress when its prerequisite evidence
and acceptance host are available.

1. **Finish live GPU presentation evidence.** Close the remaining macOS/x86_64
   live path, pixel-exact macOS checks, resize-plus-Ganesh coverage on macOS,
   and pixel-exact resize coverage on Windows. Keep Graphite as a later backend
   rather than part of the current Ganesh acceptance bar.
2. **Hardware video decode.** Complete Phase A backend bring-up and tests.
   The current blockers are the Windows D3D11VA configure path, a WSL-hosted
   binutils 2.46 `ar`/`nm` crash, and an unattempted macOS pass. Preserve a
   software fallback and report hardware use separately from decode success.
3. **Zero-copy decoded textures.** Add explicit ownership and synchronization
   for D3D surfaces, `CVPixelBuffer`/Metal textures, and VAAPI/Vulkan or native
   Linux surfaces; retain a measured copy fallback where interop is absent.
4. **Encode and capture.** Build capture, conversion, hardware/software encode,
   timestamp, and muxing paths on top of the accepted media frame contract.
5. **Networking and streaming.** Add transport, buffering, back-pressure,
   reconnect, and protocol integration only after local media timing is stable.
6. **WebRTC, then JavaScript.** Treat WebRTC as a consumer-driven integration
   milestone. Build the real QuickJS core and CRT bindings before extending
   isolated distribution acceptance from `04-gfx-media` to `05-js`; a stage
   skeleton alone is not completion.

The intended execution order is live GPU evidence, hardware decode, zero-copy
interop, encode/capture, networking/streaming, WebRTC, and finally the complete
JavaScript application-runtime layer.

### Windows process signals and Toybox `timeout`

Close the two confirmed Windows PAL gaps that keep Toybox `timeout` disabled:
`__crt_sys_kill()` currently supports only the calling process's
`kill(pid, 0)` probe and returns `ENOSYS` for a real child or process group,
while `deliver_signal()` synthesizes `SA_SIGINFO` with the caller's pid and
zero `si_code`/`si_status` even when the Windows child registry already knows
which child exited and its exit code. Keep this tranche limited to
non-interactive child lifecycle and timeout enforcement; Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break,
foreground-terminal arbitration, stopped-child reporting, and re-enabling
mksh job control remain in the separate deferred section below.

1. **Freeze the Bionic-facing contract and reproduce each failure.** Check
   Bionic's `kill()` pid-domain, errno, default-action, and `SIGCHLD`
   `siginfo_t` rules before changing the PAL. Add bounded Windows regressions
   for a live/dead foreign-pid `kill(pid, 0)` probe, positive child signaling,
   negative process-group signaling, and a child exiting with status 7 whose
   `SA_SIGINFO` handler must observe the real pid, `CLD_EXITED`, and status 7.
   Retain direct consumer evidence that `timeout 2 sleep 10` currently runs
   for roughly 10 seconds instead of enforcing its deadline.
2. **Thread real child-exit information through signal dispatch.** Extend the
   private signal backend/dispatch interface so Windows can pass a populated
   `siginfo_t` from `child_process_table`/`child_pid_table` and
   `GetExitCodeProcess()` without changing `raise()`'s self-delivery contract.
   Natural exits must report `CLD_EXITED` and the actual status; a termination
   mechanism introduced below must distinguish `CLD_KILLED` and its signal.
   Preserve the existing once-per-state-change notification and blocked-
   `SIGCHLD`/`pselect()` behavior.
3. **Implement positive-pid `kill()` with explicit, honest semantics.** Use
   documented Windows APIs for existence/access probing and `SIGKILL`; design
   a CRT-owned cooperative delivery channel for catchable signals so
   `SIGTERM`/user handlers are not silently reduced to unconditional
   `TerminateProcess()`. Define PID-reuse protection, permissions, pending-
   signal coalescing, and delivery checkpoints up front. Unsupported signals
   must fail explicitly rather than report success without delivery.
4. **Implement the non-interactive process-group subset needed by
   `timeout`.** Connect the CRT-managed pgid to real spawned-child membership
   and support Toybox's default `kill(-pgid, SIGTERM)`/`SIGKILL` path, including
   descendants. Evaluate documented Windows process groups and Job Objects
   against the post-`fork()` `setpgid(0, 0)` lifecycle before choosing the
   mechanism; do not pull in undocumented suspend/resume APIs or claim full
   POSIX job control as part of this tranche.
5. **Accept through the real packaged consumer.** Require positive-pid and
   process-group signal tests, correct `SIGCHLD` pid/code/status for natural
   and killed exits, `timeout 2 sleep 10` completing near two seconds with
   status 124, `timeout --preserve-status 10 sh -c 'exit 7'` returning 7, and
   the TERM-to-KILL `-k` path. Re-run the existing `pselect_sigchld`, process-
   stress, fd-snapshot, fork, waitpid, shell, and full Windows CTest coverage;
   rebuild the packaged shell/dist and repeat the timeout cases there. Only
   then enable the applet, update `docs/toybox_applet_status.md`, move the
   completed record to `HISTORY.md`, and remove this Planned section.

### Focused CRT/PAL follow-ups

These are real remaining limitations, but none blocks the completed
`libcrtgfx` CPU-raster milestone. Promote one into active work when a consumer
or host investigation supplies the required evidence.

- Extend the resolver from its current synchronous UDP IPv4/A-record baseline
  when IPv6, TCP fallback, search domains, or caching becomes a consumer
  requirement.
- Revisit a CRT-owned ELF loader/Android-linker boundary only after a real
  upper-runtime consumer requires behavior the host loader adapter cannot
  provide.
- Harden FreeType's fetch beyond the single SourceForge URL fix (`5b87197`)
  -- add retry-on-transient-failure, a documented fallback mirror, and
  SHA-256 verification of the cached archive before reuse, matching the
  reliability bar other `porting/recipes/*.json` ports already meet.
- Root-cause the packaged Windows `02-cxx` `<iostream>` static-initialization
  crash. Reproduce it against packaged and in-tree builds, compare `.ctors`
  and `std::ios_base::Init` startup behavior, and keep the stage runner free of
  retries that could hide the fault. `<cstdio>` working is a diagnostic fact,
  not evidence that C++ startup is complete.

### Interactive job control (deferred until it's an actual priority)

`docs/job_control.md`'s "Interactive Job Control" section has the decided
design for all three pieces below; nothing here is implemented yet, and this
project's own mksh build has job control compiled out entirely on every host
(`MKSH_NOPROSPECTOFWORK`), not just Windows -- see that section for why this
is forward-looking policy, not a current gap being actively worked.
Re-evaluated (2026-08-16) against `docs/runtime_roadmap.md`: none of the
planned upper-runtime components (`libcrtjs`/QuickJS+V8, `libcrtgfx`, `libcrtmedia`)
actually depend on POSIX job-control signals (`SIGSTOP`/`SIGTSTP`/`SIGCONT`)
or real fg/bg switching -- confirmed genuinely optional infrastructure, not
something blocking the roadmap. (V8's own "signal/process behavior"
prerequisite in that doc is a separate matter -- `SIGSEGV`-trap-based WASM
bounds checks and `SIGPROF`-style profiling, the "vectored exception
handling" question `docs/signal_delivery.md` already tracks independently,
answerable with fully documented Windows APIs.) A full Windows stop/resume
implementation would also need reversing this project's "avoid undocumented
NT internals" pattern (`NtSuspendProcess`/`NtResumeProcess` -- see
`docs/job_control.md`'s own "Stopped-child status" note for the design that
was investigated and the alternatives ruled out). Stays deferred.

- Bridge `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` (`CTRL_C_EVENT`/`CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`, both to
  `SIGINT`) into `signal_actions[]`/`raise()`, mirroring `SIGCHLD`'s existing
  pending-flag-plus-checkpoint pattern (`docs/signal_delivery.md`).
- Track the real Windows process-group id behind this project's own
  CRT-managed `pgid` integer once a job is actually spawned into a new
  process group, so `tcsetpgrp()` and a targeted `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` have a
  real id to act on.
- Re-enable `MKSH_UNEMPLOYED` (mksh's own job control) once the above exists,
  and only then decide whether stopped-child (`WIFSTOPPED`) support is worth
  the low-level Windows work it would need -- `docs/job_control.md` currently
  keeps that explicitly out of scope.

### Toybox applet expansion (deferred until it's an actual priority)

Only when the backing Bionic-compatible CRT/PAL surface exists.
Full applet-by-applet status (what's enabled,
what's still open and why, the deferred-applet list with each one's
concrete reason, and the `globals.h`/`flags.h` registration traps found
while enabling `df`/`stty`) now lives in
[`docs/toybox_applet_status.md`](docs/toybox_applet_status.md) -- this
bullet stays a pointer. Still open there: `expand`/`logger`/`fold`/
`uudecode`/`cal`/`split`/`strings` (a `globals.h` fix, plus a per-applet
`flags.h` check); `timeout` (tracked by the concrete Windows process-signal
plan above); and a confirmed-not-guessed deferred list
(`ps`/`top`/`iotop`/`pgrep`/`pkill`, `mount`/
`umount`, `ifconfig`, `login`, procfs-heavy commands).
